# Project 5: Public API Requests
 In this project, I will use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
 
 Some of the style changes I made:
 1) Changed the color of the background
 2) Changed the border thickness as well as added a color to the border of each of the "card" profiles

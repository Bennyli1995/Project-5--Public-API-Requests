# Project 5: Public API Requests
 In this project, I will use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

 Some of the style changes I made:
 1) Changed the color of the background
 2) Changed the border thickness as well as added a different color to the border of each of the "card" profiles
 3) Applied text shadow to my Name after the thumbnail photo
 4) Changed the font and font color of the quick elevator pitch after the Name
 5) Changed the alignment of the Project Name to align-center
